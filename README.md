# ChatGPT Memories Extraction Script
## Complete Setup and Usage Guide

### Overview

This Python script automatically extracts the memories ChatGPT has saved through the HTML conversation files you can download. It finds instances of the phrase "Model set context updated" and captures the message that appears immediately before it, which is the saved memory.

## What the Script Does

The script searches for this HTML pattern:
```html
<pre class="message">
  <div class="author">ChatGPT</div>
  <div>Your saved memory here</div>
</pre>
<pre class="message">
  <div class="author">ChatGPT</div>
  <div>Model set context updated.</div>
</pre>
```

**Result:** Extracts "Your saved memory here" and saves it to a text file.

## Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bs4'"
**Solution:** BeautifulSoup isn't installed properly
```bash
python -m pip install beautifulsoup4
```

### "pip is not recognized as an internal command"
**Solution:** Python isn't in PATH or isn't installed
1. Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
2. Or use: `python -m pip install beautifulsoup4`

### "No messages found in HTML file"
**Solutions:**
1. **Check file size:** Should be several MB, not 1 byte
2. **Re-save HTML:** Try the "View Source" method
3. **Remove large script tags:** If file is 100MB+, remove `<script>` tags containing encoded data

### Script runs but finds 0 results
**Possible causes:**
- HTML structure is different than expected
- The phrase "Model set context updated" isn't in the file
- File didn't save properly

**Debug steps:**
1. Open the HTML file in a text editor
2. Search for "Model set context updated" - if not found, check the exact phrase
3. Look for `<pre class="message">` tags - if not found, the structure is different
